# üé≤ Automated Galton Board

This project is a group effort aiming to build an **automated Galton Board**.  
The system is designed to automatically release balls, detect their path through different channels, and collect statistical data for visualization and analysis.

## üìñ Overview

- **Structure:** Mechanical frame of the Galton Board (built by the team).  
- **Automation & Control (my contribution):**  
  - Stepper motor controlled by Arduino to release balls.  
  - Custom-designed 3D-printed gate to regulate ball release.  
  - Infrared sensors at each channel to count the number of balls.  
  - Arduino acquisition of sensor data, transmitted via serial port.  
  - Python script to process data in real time with Matplotlib and store results in CSV for further analysis (Excel).
